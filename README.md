## Steps for Execution:
1. Clone the project repository and navigate to the root directory of the project.
2. Change into the Detection directory where the implementation notebooks and scripts are located.
3. Open the test2.py file. This notebook contains all the necessary steps to load the model and process live input.
4. If the YOLOv8 repository is not already available locally, clone it to enable model loading and training capabilities.
5. Load the custom-trained weights file (best.pt) for higher accuracy on specific road signs.
6. Update the input source on the basis of your machine's internal camera or if you are using an external camera.
7. Execute the detection cells in the notebook to start real-time road sign recognition via your system‚Äôs camera or an external camera.
8. The file automatically uses the pyttsx3 library to convert recognized road signs into voice output, providing an accessible user experience.
